                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Disrupt was trying to solve the problem of unstructured data in railway industry. As part of the Disrupt team formed during HackTrain we initially started focusing on commuters and their problems when not being aware of planned disruption in advance. Later we discovered the bottleneck in data entry and interpretation between train companies.

                <p>Train commuters are often not aware when planned disruption are taking place. This causing inconvenience and stress when passages come to the station and need to get alternative transport or change their plans. </p>

                <p>Our target group are people who commute regularly by train. These people are not checking the train availability   and they need to manually check to see if trains are in service.

                    <p>
                    Having the opportunity to be in an event supported by Railway companies we started tracking down the reasons behind such an inefficient data input. 
                    <p>Firstly we had to get our heads around the complex network of software companies involved in the data input and distribution. We needed to understand the complexities of changing the current data structure. We spoke to many engineers from other 3rd party software companies who provided us with valuable informations about their workflow. </p>

                <h4>Findings</h4>
                <p>Informations about planned disruptions are being distributed in the form of word documents by email. These are then being inputed by trained stuff using excel spreadsheet. We gained clearer understanding of the current process of producing WEC (Weekly Engineering Circular). This is sent to NRCC (National Rail Communication Centre) who then manually input it into a CMS (OpenText provided by CDT) which then feeds the data into Darwin API.</p>

                <h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
                <p>We would like to design a tool which would efficiently communicate with relevant parties and provide more useful information for end passengers. It would be very useful to automate submitting the WEC and simplify the process of data handling by direct input to CMS. This would save the time and resource of TOC employees and provide structured data model for batter integration with 3rd party applications.

                <p>
                  Our goal is now to become a middle man in passing the WEC from TOCs to NRCC, and/or a simple tool that helps generate the WEC. This will allow us to obtain the data as soon as it enters the system, and to:
                1) automate the handling of this data.
                2) provide better APIs
                3) build better tools for passenger and improve the process of inputing data to WEC

                <h4>Learnings</h4>
                <p>To change a data model in such a big and estabilished railway industry is very difficult. Although the solution is fairly simple the implementation would involve changes in many entities and would affect many people. I think the strategy of builiding a pilot with one Train Operator would prove the value proposition and get you buy in form other operators.</p>
