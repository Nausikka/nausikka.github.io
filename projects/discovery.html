                <p>Discovery is a platform which goal is to help researchers with finding the right human genomic data for their research. By introducing the set of community and annotation features we would like to connect users together and enable to contribute with valuable information to improve the quality of the current data.

                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>The quality of genomic data can be very poor, especially data sets from publicly available repositories. Data models are very complex and inconsistent across different repositories. Finding relevant datasets for a research is very time-consuming and daunting. 
                  <br/>
                  Often researchers has to download big files to asses the quality and relevance of data.

                <p>Build a set of features which will allow users to explore activity on the platform and encourage them on collaboration to create useful content. Empower and motivate users to become 'Repositive Champions’. The final list of features was: Notification, Reputation score, Metadata curation, Follow a dataset, User profile (adding interests, and social accounts), Self allocation of dataset, Recommentation, Searching trought other than data sets (users, interests), Create collection, Invite users, Upvote/Downvote, Request Help.

                  For the basic features we skipped the high-fidelity mockups and provided only paper sketches. To avoid any misunderstanding when implementing the features we communicated closely the flow through the sketches to dev team and used github for any additional input. Sometimes we video recorded the developer going through the flow to make sure all steps are interpreted correctly.

                  We have chosen story mapping to capture the ideas and steps of the user journey. I think it’s very effective method to get the whole picture of the feature and the minimum flow to achieve good user experience. Additionally, it’s nice to capture and explore more ideas which we were able to divide into future releases.

                    <p>Every week we had remote usability testings with people from our <a  href="https://blog.repositive.io/what-we-learnt-from-building-a-user-council/">User Council</a> where we tested basic interactions of the prototypes, mainly to ensure the terminology and intended functionality makes sense. I learnt that scenario you give the user is very important on the tester background. They should be familiar with the scenario, especial if the tested feature is on very specialised subject (e.g curating and annotating categories of a datasets).  </p>

                      <h4>Outcomes and learnings</h4>
                    <p>Within 6 months we managed to develop 5 of 10 faetures we planned. We over estimated the scope of the features but the process worked quite well. Although general features (Notification, Edit Profile or Dataset) works quite well individually others like User Reputation would need more holistic integration to provide good user experience.</p>

                <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                <p>During developing better Search functionality I spent most of time conducting Usability tests. These were mainly to validate our concepts on filtering, data sets layout and browsing. The designs were showed through video as a user story which was very effective to communicate the concept. However it wouldn't capture all usability issues which could appear when interacting with the search directly.

                <p>Before start improving designs for Search we conducted contextual interviews to see how human genomics researchers in pharma currently solve their problem with finding data. We needed more insight into data search of users who work in industry setup. The big challenge was in recruiting participants as the employees are very bind with high confidentiality policies.
