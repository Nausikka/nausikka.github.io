                <p>Discovery is a platform which goal is to help researchers with finding the right human genomic data for their research. By introducing the set of community and annotation features we would like to connect users together and enable to contribute with valuable information to improve the quality of the current data.

                <p>The quality of genomic data can be very poor, especially data sets from publicly available repositories. Data models are very complex and inconsistent across different repositories. Finding relevant datasets for a research is very time-consuming and daunting.

The target user groups are Academics: Phd Students, PostDoc and Scientist working in Pharma companies or in Biotech. We realised that curing the datasets is very big challenge and the idea of crowdsourcing would work only if we design strong incentives for users. We went the most obvious strategy - gamification which didn’t really take off and the poor  quality of dataset are remaining problem.

                <p>There was no prior research on this project. The decision was made within company as a our stakeholders believed their assumption and we had resources to go ahead with development. We did many internal brainstorming sessions where the whole team was involved in feature generating ideas.

                However we were conducting usability testings during the design and development phase.

                  We were having 2 weeks design sprints through with 
                  We tackled  the issue with time constrains to skip hi-fi mockup for basic features. To avoid any misunderstanding when implementing the features we communicated closely the flow through the sketches to dev team and used github for any additional input. Sometimes we video recorded the developer going through the flow to make sure all steps are interpreted correctly.

                  We have chosen story mapping for the ideas and steps of the users journey. I think it’s very effective method to get the whole picture of the feature and the minimum flow to achieve good user experience. Additionally, it’s nice to capture and explore more ideas which we were able to divide interactions into future releases.

                    <p>Every week we had 2 usability testings where we tested basic interactions of the prototypes, mainly to ensure the terminology and intended functionality makes sense.

                <p>We conducted contextual interviews to see how human genomics researchers currently solve their problem with finding data: with a focus on how they search for data – current habits. What tools they use to make their work easier and What their greatest pain points and frustrations are.
                   <br/><br/>
We've created a group of volunteers mostly from academia who were available for the interviews and usability testings in future. We called them User Council link to user council.
