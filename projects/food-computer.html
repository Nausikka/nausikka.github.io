                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>This is my life project and really good fun. I wanted to combine my two big passions technology and nature. As a person who likes gardening I wanted to create automated environment where I could experiment with growing different types of plants. I am documenting the progress on <a href="https://github.com/Nausikka/fc0.1"> github </a> and I am happy to chat if you would like to start similar project.

                <p>MIT has it's own version of food computer (currently 2.0) which is open source and documetation is getting better. The project is quite complex and some components are quite expensive and difficult to get in UK</p>

                <h4>Concept</h4>
                <p>The idea of food computer is to have automated system to created controled environment for growing plants. All necessary factors for plants: light, water, air, humidity and temperature would be controled by Arduino which would be connected to appropriated devices. There would be set of sensors capturing real time data of the current environment status.

                <h4>Connecting devices</h4>
                <p>I didn't have much experience with electronics when I started with the project and I am still learning the mysteries of electrons. I find it quite fascinating how simple idea can get so complex. I've been facing many challenges when adding more devices to arduino, spending hours trying figuring out where the problem was. You can read my build diary on <a href="https://github.com/Nausikka/fc0.1"> github </a>. It's quite sparse but I'll keep adding more info as I move on ;)

                <p>
                  OK, so this is not that much about electronics but it's very important part of the project. Choosing the right hydrophonic system and seting it all up required some design thinking too. The system is combination of Ebb and flow and floating platfrom. I have chosen this approach to have better control over the water level as I can control the overflow and using the airstones to make sure the roots are getting enough o2.

                <p>
                  At first I tried to follow MIT food computer guide, but the complexity was just overwhelming and very frustrating to get started. I abbandoned the MIT version and started my own with very simple features. I am slowly improving the version 1.0 while actually growing plants.

                  Currently I am working on adding sensors. The idea is to connect the sensors to wifi and send over to my website. I've been playing with ESP8266 wifi module which is basically arduino with wifi.
